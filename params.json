The output result can be set as LaTex or plain text.\r\nYou can see here an example of a pdf matrix confusion output:\r\n\r\n![matrix confusion pdf example](../images/confusionMatrixPdf.png)\r\n\r\n###Command:\r\n```\r\n-compare <goldStandard> <fileToCompare> <output> [options]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompares `goldStandard` file against `fileToCompare` generating a confusion matrix as output.\r\n\r\n`[options]` is one or more of the followings:\r\n\r\n`-l`: Set latex output, default is text plain output.\r\n\r\n`-t=<matrixTitle>`: Matrix title to be written on output file.\r\n\r\n`-rt=<rowTitle>`: Row title to be written on output file.\r\n\r\n`-ct=<columnTitle>`: Column title to be written on output file.\r\n\r\n`-SC=<specificCellsFile>`: Use a custom file to set specific cells to be showed .\r\n\r\n`-T=<translationFile>`: Specify a custom tags translation file to be used on comparision. The \r\ntranslation is applied to `fileToCompare` tags in order to convert them to goldStandard tags.\r\n\r\n`-s=<size>`: If latex output is set, size sets matrix size. If text plain output is set, size sets quantity of different words for each cell.\r\n\r\n##Files splitter:\r\nThis tool splits a file in several parts, preserving sentences.\r\nOptionally generates the complementary file of each part extracted.\r\n\r\n###Command:\r\n```\r\n-split <file> <parts> [options]\r\n```\r\n`[options]` is one or more of the followings:\r\n\r\n`-c[=complementPrefix]`: Generate a complement file for each part. If specified, complement file names will be generated using `complementPrefix` as the base name. Default complementPrefix is 'Comp'\r\n\r\n`-r`: Random selection of senteneces.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
