{"name":"Tagging Tools","tagline":"Useful set of tools for part of speech (POS) tagging","body":"# Tagging Tools\r\nUseful set of tools for [POST (Part-of-speech tagging)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging)  common tasks such as confusion matrix generation and file split. \r\n\r\n## Confusion matrix generator\r\nDefine 2 files to compare (gold standard and tagged file) and build the confusion matrix. The output can be set as LaTex or plain text.\r\n\r\nYou can see below an example of a pdf confusion matrix output. By default the cells with the biggest differences are shown.\r\n\r\n###Pdf output:\r\n![pdf confusion matrix example](https://raw.github.com/ferrod20/taggingTools/gh-pages/images/confusionMatrixPdf.png)\r\n\r\nIn the next example you can see a plain text confusion matrix output. Notice that for each cell the file shows the words whose tags differ.\r\n\r\n###Plain text output:\r\n![plain text confusion matrix example](https://raw.github.com/ferrod20/taggingTools/gh-pages/images/plainTextConfusionMatrixComparision.png)\r\n\r\n###Tags translation:\r\nYou can also use a tags translation file in order to convert tags from one tagset into another before the comparison occurs. Penn Treebank-C5 translation is included as an example.\r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n```dos\r\ntt -compare <goldStandard> <fileToCompare> <output> [options]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompares `goldStandard` file against `fileToCompare` generating a confusion matrix as output.\r\n\r\n`[options]` is one or more of the following:\r\n\r\n`-l`: Set latex output, default is text plain output.\r\n\r\n`-t=<matrixTitle>`: Matrix title to be written on output file.\r\n\r\n`-rt=<rowTitle>`: Row title to be written on output file.\r\n\r\n`-ct=<columnTitle>`: Column title to be written on output file.\r\n\r\n`-SC=<specificCellsFile>`: Use a custom file to set specific cells to be shown.\r\n\r\n`-T=<translationFile>`: Specify a custom tags translation file to be used on comparison. The \r\ntranslation is applied to `fileToCompare` tags in order to convert them to goldStandard tags.\r\n\r\n`-s=<size>`: If latex output is set, size sets matrix size. If plain text output is set, size sets quantity of different words for each cell.\r\n\r\n##Files splitter:\r\nThis tool splits a file in several parts, preserving sentences.\r\nIt optionally generates the complementary file for each extracted part.\r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n```dos\r\ntt -split <file> <parts> [options]\r\n```\r\n`[options]` is one or more of the following:\r\n\r\n`-c[=complementPrefix]`: Generates a complement file for each part. If specified, complement file names will be generated using `complementPrefix` as the base name. Default complementPrefix is 'Comp'\r\n\r\n`-r`: Random selection of senteneces.\r\n\r\n##File format:\r\nSentences are composed of tokens (words and symbols).\r\n\r\nEach line should contain a token. Empty lines will be used to denote sentence break.\r\n\r\nFor comparison operations, each line must contain the token followed by a tab and the POS tag.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![file format example](https://raw.github.com/ferrod20/taggingTools/gh-pages/images/fileFormat.png)\r\n\r\n##Binaries:\r\nLinux and Windows binaries are available [here](https://github.com/ferrod20/taggingTools/tree/binaries)\r\n","google":"UA-35949516-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
